I have a review mcp: elementor-cursor-review-mcp
But I would like to simplify this. 

I prefer to use an existing mcp instead.

In our environment we can access our repos and PRs with GITHUB_TOKEN.

We have created an initial rules set: elementor-cursor-review-mcp/rules.

We already have the 'Github Pull Requests' extension installed.

What I would like to do: 
Provide the Github PR link in the cursor agent chat.
The agent studies the diff.
Compare with our rules.
Creates feedback: 
1. inside an MD document in the root folder of that repo, such as e.g. '/elementor'. Ensure that for every comments we provide file paths and line numbers.
2. Request if we would like to push our comments to the PR. This should be done with inline comments.

00-github-reviews/CHATGPT.md has created some suggestions how we can implement this.

First question: can we use the Github MCP for our '/elementor' repo?
Second question: does the Github MCP assist us?

Create 2 or 3 proposals how we can implement this in our project here. The proposal doens't have to contain the Github MCP. Recommend what workflow is best.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Automated GitHub PR Review System with Cursor AI

### 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** GitHub PR Review Assistant for Cursor AI  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Owner:** Jan van Vlastuin  
**Status:** Draft

**Purpose:** Create a simplified, manual-triggered PR review system that leverages Cursor AI to analyze GitHub PRs against custom coding rules, providing structured feedback in markdown documents and optionally posting inline comments to GitHub PRs.

---

### 2. Current State Analysis

#### 2.1 Existing Assets
- **Custom MCP Server:** `elementor-cursor-review-mcp` (currently complex, needs simplification)
- **Coding Rules:** 22 comprehensive rule files in `elementor-cursor-review-mcp/rules/`
- **GitHub Integration:** Access via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (environment variable)
- **IDE Extension:** GitHub Pull Requests extension installed in Cursor
- **Target Repository:** `/elementor` (private repository)

#### 2.2 Constraints
- No access to Cursor Background Agents (paid tier)
- Manual trigger workflow required (not automated CI/CD)
- Private GitHub repository access
- Need to maintain security and audit trail

#### 2.3 Current Problems
- Existing `elementor-cursor-review-mcp` is too complex
- No streamlined workflow for PR reviews
- Inconsistent application of coding standards
- Manual review process is time-consuming

---

### 3. Goals and Objectives

#### 3.1 Primary Goals
1. **Simplify Review Process:** Replace complex custom MCP with simpler solution
2. **Consistent Standards:** Apply 22 coding rules consistently across all PRs
3. **Reduce Review Time:** Automate first-pass review to free up human reviewers
4. **Maintain Quality:** Ensure reviews are thorough and actionable

#### 3.2 Success Metrics
- Review feedback generated within 2 minutes of providing PR URL
- 80%+ of coding rule violations caught automatically
- 50% reduction in initial review time for human reviewers
- Zero false positives in critical security checks
- 100% of feedback includes file path and line numbers

#### 3.3 Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Fully automated CI/CD integration (future consideration)
- Auto-merging of PRs
- Direct code modifications by AI
- Support for multiple repositories simultaneously

---

### 4. Solution Proposals

#### 4.1 Proposal A: GitHub MCP Server (Recommended)

**Architecture:**
```
User → Cursor Chat → GitHub MCP Server → GitHub API
                  ↓
              Local MD File
```

**Components:**
1. **GitHub MCP Server** (self-hosted or existing)
   - Handles authentication with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - Provides secure API layer for Cursor
   - Endpoints: `/pr/diff`, `/pr/files`, `/pr/comment`

2. **Cursor Integration**
   - Configure MCP server URL in Cursor settings
   - Load 22 coding rules as context
   - Structured prompt for PR analysis

3. **Output Handlers**
   - Primary: Generate MD file in `/elementor/pr-reviews/PR-{number}.md`
   - Optional: Post inline comments via GitHub API

**Workflow:**
1. User pastes PR URL in Cursor chat
2. Cursor fetches PR diff via MCP server
3. Cursor analyzes against coding rules
4. Cursor generates structured markdown review
5. User reviews feedback
6. User triggers optional comment posting to GitHub

**Pros:**
- Most secure (token handled by MCP server)
- Audit trail built-in
- Reusable for other repos
- Can extend to other GitHub operations

**Cons:**
- Requires MCP server setup
- Additional infrastructure to maintain
- Learning curve for MCP protocol

**Estimated Setup Time:** 4-6 hours

---

#### 4.2 Proposal B: Direct GitHub API Integration

**Architecture:**
```
User → Cursor Chat → GitHub REST API (via GITHUB_TOKEN)
                  ↓
              Local MD File
```

**Components:**
1. **Cursor Agent Workflow**
   - Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` directly in Cursor environment
   - Create custom Cursor command/prompt
   - Fetch PR data via GitHub REST API

2. **Helper Scripts** (optional)
   - `fetch-pr-diff.sh`: Downloads PR diff using token
   - `post-comments.sh`: Posts review comments to PR

3. **Rule Integration**
   - Load rule files as Cursor workspace rules
   - Reference rules in system prompt

**Workflow:**
1. User pastes PR URL in Cursor chat
2. Cursor calls helper script to fetch PR diff (or uses REST API directly)
3. Cursor analyzes diff against rules
4. Cursor generates MD review in repo root
5. User optionally runs helper script to post comments

**Pros:**
- Simpler setup (no MCP server)
- Direct API access (faster)
- Easier to debug
- Lower maintenance overhead

**Cons:**
- Token security concerns (exposed in Cursor env)
- Less audit trail
- Manual scripting required
- Not as extensible

**Estimated Setup Time:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 4.3 Proposal C: Hybrid Approach (Manual Diff Paste)

**Architecture:**
```
User → Manual PR Diff Download → Cursor Chat → Local MD File
                                             ↓
                                  Optional Script → GitHub API
```

**Components:**
1. **Manual Diff Retrieval**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
        https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/{PR}.diff > pr.diff
   ```

2. **Cursor Processing**
   - User pastes diff content into Cursor chat
   - Cursor applies 22 coding rules
   - Generates structured review

3. **Optional Comment Poster**
   - Small Node.js/Python script
   - Reads Cursor's JSON output
   - Posts to GitHub via REST API

**Workflow:**
1. User downloads PR diff manually
2. User pastes diff into Cursor
3. Cursor analyzes and generates review MD
4. User optionally runs script to post comments

**Pros:**
- Zero infrastructure setup
- Complete control over process
- No security concerns (token only in local scripts)
- Can start immediately

**Cons:**
- Most manual workflow
- No integration benefits
- Multiple steps required
- Prone to human error

**Estimated Setup Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### 5. Recommended Approach

**Selected Proposal:** **Proposal B (Direct GitHub API Integration)** with path to upgrade to Proposal A

**Rationale:**
1. **Fastest Time to Value:** Can start using within 2-3 hours
2. **Simplicity:** No MCP server infrastructure needed initially
3. **Iterative Path:** Can migrate to MCP later if needed
4. **Meets Requirements:** Fulfills all stated goals
5. **Lower Risk:** Fewer moving parts, easier to debug

**Migration Path:**
- Phase 1: Implement Proposal B (Weeks 1-2)
- Phase 2: Evaluate MCP benefits (Week 3)
- Phase 3: Migrate to Proposal A if ROI justifies it (Week 4+)

## Review Process
1. Parse the PR diff to understand all changes
2. Apply each of the 22 coding rules
3. Identify violations, improvements, and positive patterns
4. Generate structured markdown report

## Output Format
Generate a markdown report with:
- Executive summary
- Issues grouped by severity
- Each issue must include: [file:line] reference
- Specific rule violated
- Recommended fix with code example
- Positive observations

## Severity Definitions
- **Critical:** Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking changes
- **High:** Performance issues, architectural problems, major bugs
- **Medium:** Code style violations, minor bugs, technical debt
- **Low:** Suggestions, optimizations, best practices

## Rules to Apply
