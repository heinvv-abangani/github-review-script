### In Terminal

```bash
cd github-review-script

# Review
./review.sh https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/32958

# Post
./post-comments.sh

# Cleanup (manual)
./cleanup.sh
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ PR Number in Filenames
All files now start with `PR-[NUMBER]`:
- `PR-32958-2025-10-06.md`
- `PR-32958-comments.json`

### ✅ Auto-Detection
`post-comments.sh` automatically finds the most recent JSON file:
```bash
./post-comments.sh
# Finds: ../pr-reviews/PR-32958-comments.json
# Extracts: PR number = 32958
# Posts to: GitHub PR #32958
```

### ✅ Auto-Cleanup
After posting comments, files older than 3 days are removed:
```bash
🧹 Cleaning up files older than 3 days...
  🗑️  Deleting: PR-27890-2025-10-03.md
  🗑️  Deleting: PR-27890-comments.json
  ✅ Deleted 2 file(s)
```

## 📖 Next Steps

### 1. Setup GitHub Token (if not done)
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Test the Workflow
```bash
cd github-review-script
./review.sh https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/32958
# Copy prompt to Cursor Chat
```

### 3. Read the Documentation

- Quick ref: [README-SIMPLE.md](./README-SIMPLE.md)

## 🎨 Cursor Chat Integration

You can now use these simple commands in Cursor:

```
review https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/32958
```

Cursor will:
1. Fetch PR diff
2. Apply 22 coding rules
3. Generate review markdown
4. Generate comments JSON

Then:
```
post comments
```

Cursor will:
1. Find latest JSON
2. Post to GitHub
3. Run cleanup

## 📊 File Naming Convention

| Old Pattern | New Pattern |
|-------------|-------------|
| `PR-123-2025-10-06.md` | ✅ `PR-32958-2025-10-06.md` |
| `comments-corrected.json` | ✅ `PR-32958-comments.json` |
| `comments-to-post.json` | ✅ `PR-32958-comments.json` |

All files now have PR number prefix for easy identification!

## 🧹 Automatic Cleanup

After posting comments, cleanup runs automatically:

```bash
📤 Posting comments...
  ↳ tracking-context.js:15 [CRITICAL]
    ✅ Posted

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ✅ Posted: 5 comments
