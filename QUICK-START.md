# Quick Start Guide: PR Review with GitHub MCP

## üöÄ Fast Setup (5 Minutes)

### For Users with GitHub Copilot (Recommended)

1. **Configure MCP in Cursor:**
   - Open Cursor Settings: `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows)
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
   - Add this configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "servers": {
         "github": {
           "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
           "type": "http",
           "auth": {
             "type": "oauth",
             "scopes": ["repo", "read:org", "workflow"]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Save and restart Cursor

2. **Authenticate:**
   - Cursor will prompt for GitHub authorization
   - Click "Authorize" and select your GitHub account

3. **Test Connection:**
   - Open Cursor chat
   - Type: "List recent PRs in elementor/elementor"
   - If successful, you're ready!

### For Users Without GitHub Copilot (Docker + PAT)

1. **Create GitHub Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate token with `repo`, `read:org`, `workflow` scopes
   - Copy token

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Mac/Linux
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
   
   # Add to ~/.zshrc for persistence:
   echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Configure MCP in Cursor:**
   - Open Cursor Settings: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Open User Settings (JSON)"
   - Add:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "servers": {
         "github": {
           "command": "docker",
           "args": [
             "run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
             "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest"
           ],
           "env": {
             "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Pull Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest
   ```
