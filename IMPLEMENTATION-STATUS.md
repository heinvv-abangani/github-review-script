## 🎯 Next Steps (Your Action Items)

### Step 1: Choose MCP Option (5 minutes)

**Option A: GitHub Hosted MCP** (Recommended if you have Copilot)
- ✅ Pros: No setup, automatic updates, OAuth authentication
- ⚠️ Requires: GitHub Copilot subscription
- 📖 Follow: QUICK-START.md → "For Users with GitHub Copilot"

**Option B: Self-Hosted MCP** (If no Copilot)
- ✅ Pros: No subscription needed, full control
- ⚠️ Requires: Docker + GitHub token setup
- 📖 Follow: QUICK-START.md → "For Users Without GitHub Copilot"

### Step 2: Configure MCP in Cursor (10 minutes)

1. **Open Cursor Settings:**
   ```
   Cmd+Shift+P → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
   ```

2. **Add MCP Configuration:**
   - See QUICK-START.md for exact configuration
   - Choose hosted or self-hosted config
   - Save and restart Cursor

3. **Authenticate:**
   - Hosted: OAuth authorization in browser
   - Self-hosted: Create GitHub token and set `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### Step 3: Verify MCP Connection (5 minutes)

1. **Open Cursor Chat**

2. **Test Connection:**
   ```
   List recent PRs in elementor/elementor
   ```

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Cursor connects to GitHub MCP
   - Returns list of recent PRs
   - No authentication errors

4. **If Issues:**
   - See MCP-SETUP-GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting
   - Check status bar for MCP connection status
   - Verify authentication credentials

### Step 4: Test with Sample PR (10 minutes)

1. **Choose a Closed PR for Testing:**
   - Pick a recently merged PR
   - Preferably with TypeScript/React changes
   - Example: https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/[RECENT_PR]

2. **Run Helper Script:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/janvanvlastuin1981/Local Sites/elementor/app/public/wp-content"
   ./scripts/review-pr-mcp.sh https://github.com/elementor/elementor/pull/[NUMBER]
   ```

3. **Copy Prompt to Cursor:**
   - Script will generate detailed prompt
   - Copy and paste into Cursor chat
   - Wait for review generation

4. **Review Output:**
   - Open generated file in `pr-reviews/`
   - Verify structure matches expected format
   - Check for accurate file:line references
   - Validate rule citations

### Step 5: Refine and Iterate (Ongoing)

1. **Evaluate Initial Review:**
   - Check for false positives
   - Verify critical issues are caught
   - Assess recommendation quality

2. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - Refine prompts for better results
   - Update coding rules if needed
   - Optimize review workflow

3. **Share with Team:**
   - Document learnings
   - Share setup instructions
   - Collect feedback
